##Slide 2 - Example of comments and docstrings

# --- demo of an in-line comment
age = 115 # age of the oldest ever living person


"""Sometimes there is a need to explain or document a portrion of code beyond one line.
For this we can use a docstring to extend to multiple lines.
Docstrings are also used to attribute programs and explain functions."""

# --- Slide 4 - code literals - how data types are represented to the programming language
# a = 4
# b = '4'
# print(a,b)
# print(a + a, b + b, str(a) + str(int(b)))


##Slide 5 - place value representation
# liams_number = 84,000
# print(liams_number)
#
# print(1,234) # This prints two separate pieces of data
#
# liams_number_part2 = 848_120_000
# print(liams_number_part2)



##Slide 7 - String literals
# print("that's") # use double quotes of a single quote is part of the string

# --  Often the choice of single or double quote does not matter
# print("A double quoted string")
# print('does the same thing as a single quoted string')

# -- Perhaps an exception
# print('However, there\'ll be times when a string needs to include a single quote within it, so a double quote is useful')


## Multiline strings look similar to docstrings
# welcomeText = '''Welcome to my game!
#
# I will think of a number from 1 to 100, and you must try
# to guess it. I'll tell you if your guess is too small
# or too large.
#
#
#         # Enter an integer between 1 and 100 when prompted.'''
#
#
# print(welcomeText)


##Slide 8 - Escape characters
# print('Hello. How are you?')
# #
# print("1. hello " + 'there') #Substitute one of the escape chars for the '#'
# print("2. hello\b " + ' there')
# print("3. hello\n " + '  there')
# print("4. hello\t " + ' there')
# print("5. hello\\" + ' there')
# print("6. hello\'"" " + ' there')
# print("7.hello\"" + ' there')




##Slide 10 - End of line arguments
# print("Hello")# Drops to new line
# print("there")
#
# seperator = ' --#-- '
# print('hello', end = seperator)
# print('there')




##Slide 11 - separator arguments
# name = 'Yoda'
# age = 900
# home_planet = 'Dagobah'
#
# ## using sep
# print(name, age, home_planet)
# print(name, age, home_planet, sep = ', ')
# print(name, age, home_planet, sep = ' *** ')
#
# ##  combine sep and end
# print(name, age, home_planet, sep=", ", end=' :) ')
# print("The End")

###Activity from slide 13
## Three valid Variables


## Three Invalid variables



##Slide 14 - variable assignment through concatenation
# first_name = "Obi-Wan"
# last_name = "Kenobi"




## Reassigning Variables to new values
# x = 125
pass    # y defined in terms of x


pass   # redefining x



pass   # redefining y by modifying



##Slide 15 - Review Concatenation vs. comma seperation
# first_name = "Yuriy"
# last_name = "Drubinskiy"

pass # Concatenation
pass # comma seperated arguments


## Slide 16 - The * string operation
s1 = 'waaz'
s2 = 'a'
s3 = 'p'





### ACTIVITY slide 17 - Write a print statement that outputs the string seen in slide 17 of the powerpoint



##Slide 18 - Examples of math operations
pass #Exponents
pass # QUOTIENT
pass # Modulus (mod)
pass

pass
pass



# a = 1
pass # Increment and reassign to itself




## Slide 20 Mixed-Mode Arithmetic
# a = 6
# b = 3
pass
pass # True division Results in a float
pass # Quotient Division rounds down to an int


# c = 0.7
pass # Addition using at least one float always results in a float





#Slide 22 - recasting review
a = '33'
b = 5
c = 4.0
d = 'one'

pass # int to float
pass # float to str
pass # str to int
pass # str to int - ERROR


## SLide 23 rounding floats





##Slide 24 - Character operations
# s1 = "Mary"
# s2 = "Freddy"

pass #Get the lenght of string s1 and s2
pass # Get the ASCII code of the character
pass #Get the character from the ASCII code
pass #Find the smallest and largest ASCII character of s2


##Playing around with some character codes in unicode
# print(chr(0x265e))
# print(chr(0x250C))
# print(chr(203850))
# print(int(0x265e))
# print(chr(9822))

# print('The ASCII code for the letter \'a\' is ' + str(ord('a')))

# for i in range (9000, 10000):
#     print(chr((i)), end = ', ')
